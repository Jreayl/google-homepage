This is my first ever attempt at creating a website. This website is a copy of the google homepage in aesthetics only.
The search bar has no functionality and neither do any of the links. There are some things I would like to improve such as
the search icon in the search bar not moving around while resizing the window. Also, I would like to change the navbar
at the top of the screen to more closely resemble the actual google homepage. 

I learned a lot from this project even though it is very basic and hope to continue improving my skills throughout future
projects :)
